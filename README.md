2- install vscode
3- open vscode and clik on manager extantion and search code runner then install it
4- search go in manager extention of vscode and install it.

for installation=>
go get -v -u github.com/gorilla/mux

https://tutorialedge.net/golang/golang-mysql-tutorial/
go mod init my_application name (for creating mod file)
go mod init github.com/spathak510/go-course(for creating mod file)


set every new project (set GOPATH=d:\you\project\directory\) and (set GOBIN=d:\you\project\directory\bin)





make the proram=>
1- Package Declaration
2- import packages
3- The main package is the starting point to run the program. Each package has a path and name associated with it.
	The next line import "fmt" is a preprocessor command which tells the Go compiler to include the files lying in the package fmt.
	The next line func main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
4-A token is the smallest element of a program that is meaningful to the compiler. Tokens can be classified as follows=>
	


Progress in Go language 
1- First of all, Today i have install some packages=>
(a)- Go
(b)- VSCode
2- And then I followed tutorialsPoint for learing Go language. Where, 
     I have done some points-
     (a)-Environment setup
     (b)- Program Structure
     (c)- Basice syntax
     (d)- Keywords=>
		Go haveing 25 keywords-
		interface,  select,  defer,	Go,	Struct,  chan,	 package,  const,    fallthrough
     (e)- Varialbes-
		//1st method
		var a int      /* declaration */
		     a = 10    /* initialiation */

		//2nd method	
		var a int = 10 /* declaration  with initialiation */
		var a = 10     /* declaration  with initialiation */

		//3rd method
		a := 10       /* declaration  with initialiation,out side the function it's not workeble */
		
		Variable types - 
			1st local variable(it will be accessible only into the function).
			2nd globl variable(make sure, it will be in Pascal_case(first latter in upper_case,like-"Val2"),It have scope only that package where it is declieared).
			3rd package_level variable(make sure, it will be in Camel_case(second latter in upper_case ,like-"myValue"),It have scope in all packages).

		For check the variable value and type we can use %v and %T.			
		
     (f)- Constants
     (g)- Oprators
     (h)- Decision making


Progress in Go language
Today I  have made REST API. 
for creating Rest API, I have learn some points -
1- Router
2- Handler
3- Gorilla/mux
And I also tested this API with POSTMAN.
